# bounce!
## This physics based game requries patience, skill, luck, and a fast clicking finger.

The object of the game is to get a high score, but more than that, bouncing this ball is just plain fun. The ball starts with some velocity and gravity. Take advantage of these to climb higher and score more points. You earn 1 point for bouncing on a line you've drawn by clicking.
