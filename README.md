# bounce!
## This physics based game requries patience, skill, luck, and a fast clicking finger.

The object of the game is to fill the bottom of the screen with floor tiles which are earned by collecting gems. Hitting a skull will destroy a random floor tile. Your ball can destroy a floor tile, too, which may save you from losing the game. When the ball does hit a floor tile, it bounces straight up, which may be helpful when the gravity, velocity, and physics get crazy. The ball starts with some velocity and gravity. Take advantage of these to climb higher and collect those gems.
